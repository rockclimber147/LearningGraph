## Folder Structure

An initial react project has this folder structure:

```text
Root
  node_modules
  public
  src
    App.css
    App.tsx
    index.css
    main.tsx
  .gitignore
  eslint.config.js
  index.html
  package-lock.json
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.app.json
  tsconfig.json
  tsconfig.node.json
  vite.config.ts
```

### node_modules

* Contains **all downloaded dependencies** for your project.

* Auto-generated by `npm install`.

* You never edit anything here manually.

* Always added to `.gitignore`.

### public

* Contains **static assets** that will be copied directly into the final build.

* In Vite, this includes files you want to reference by absolute path, like:

  * `/logo.png`

  * `/robots.txt`

  * `/favicon.ico`

Anything in `public/` is **not bundled**—it’s just copied as-is.

### src

* Contains **all your application code**:

  * React components

  * Styles

  * TypeScript files

  * Hooks, state, business logic

This is the folder you work in 95% of the time.

### `src/App.css`

* Optional CSS file containing styles for your `App` component.

* Automatically included by `App.tsx`.

### `src/App.tsx`

* Your **root React component**.

* This is the UI component that your entire app starts from.

* Typically contains routing, layout, or app-wide providers.

### `src/index.css`

* Global stylesheet applied to your whole app.

* Usually contains resets or global rules.

### `.gitignore`

* Tells Git which files/folders to ignore.

* Commonly excludes:

  * `node_modules/`

  * build output (`dist/`)

  * environment files (`.env`)

  * local settings

###

### `eslint.config.js`

* Configuration for **ESLint**, a tool that catches code errors and enforces style rules.

* Helps keep your project clean and consistent.

### `index.html`

* The single HTML file used by your app.

* Vite injects your JavaScript bundle into this.

* Contains:

  * `<div id="root"></div>` where React mounts your app

  * Metadata (title, favicon, etc.)

### `package-lock.json`

* Auto-generated when you run `npm install`.

* Locks down exact dependency versions for repeatable installs.

* Don't edit this manually.

### `package.json`

* Defines your project’s:

  * Name, version

  * Dependencies

  * Scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, etc.)

  * Tool configs

* This is one of the most important files in any JavaScript project.

### `README.md`

* Markdown documentation of your project.

* Instructions for:

  * Setup

  * Running

  * Building

  * Features

You should edit this to reflect your project.

### `tsconfig.json`

* Global **TypeScript configuration**.

* Controls TypeScript behavior across the whole project:

  * strict mode

  * module system

  * target JS version

### `tsconfig.app.json`

* Extends `tsconfig.json`

* Configures TypeScript **specifically for your app code** (in `src/`).

* Vite uses this to build the actual project files.

### `tsconfig.node.json`

* TypeScript config for Node-related files (like Vite config files).

* Ensures TypeScript understands Node modules, globals, and import styles in config files.

### `vite.config.ts`

* The configuration for **Vite**, your build tool.

* Controls:

  * Plugins (e.g., React plugin)

  * Dev server settings

  * Path aliases (`@/components`)

  * Build options

You usually edit this only for custom setups.
