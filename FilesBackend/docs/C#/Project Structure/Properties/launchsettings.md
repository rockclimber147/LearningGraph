# launchSettings.json

**Role:** This file defines the **launch profiles** used by VS Code and the command line to start your application locally.

**What it does:** It specifies *how* your app is run, including:

* The **URL** and **port** the server should listen on (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

* The **environment variables** to use (e.g., setting `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` to `Development`).

* Whether to launch a web browser when the application starts.
