Entitlement Theory of Justice

Rejects utilitarianism (not ok to use people as means)

Also because the past is relevant for distributive justice

Someone is entitled to a holding if it has been\
acquired through repeated applications of:

* Justice in acquisition of holdings (e.g. do not steal,\
  defraud or enslave)

* Justice in transfer (e.g. free market, no taking\
  advantage of monopoly)

* (Some rectification principle)
