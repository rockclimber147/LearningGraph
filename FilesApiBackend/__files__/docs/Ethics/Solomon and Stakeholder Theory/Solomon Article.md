## Corporate Roles and Personal Virtues

The provided text argues for an approach to business ethics centered on **personal virtues** and **social harmony**, largely drawing from the Aristotelian tradition, and moving away from narrow, rule-based, or "bottom-line" ethics.

### 1. Ethics as Appreciation and Engagement

* **Focus on Character:** Ethics, especially in business, should focus on the **details of personal character** (e.g., trust, respect, sleaziness) crucial for interpersonal decisions, rather than abstract concepts of "right" and "wrong."

* **Virtues as Excellence:** An Aristotelian virtue is an **excellence** in getting along with others, reflecting the ideals and aims of the entire community, not just a specialized skill.

  * **Honesty** is a virtue because it represents straight dealing and open inquiry, not just because it's "the best policy."

  * **Courage** is about standing up for beliefs, not just talent.

* **Congenial Virtues:** The text emphasizes "getting along" and includes **charm, wit, and a good sense of humor** as important virtues in corporate life, suggesting that a focus solely on "heroic" or necessary virtues ignores the qualities that make work and life fulfilling.

### 2. The Social Nature of Virtues

* **Beyond "Morality":** Many virtues are **social and congenial** (like loyalty, generosity, wit) and should not be strictly separated into "moral" and "non-moral" categories, as the concept of "morality" has become overly narrow and principled.

* **Purpose of Business Virtues:** A business virtue is important if it contributes to the **social harmony** of the organization and helps an employee or manager feel "whole" rather than fragmented.

* **Contrasting Metaphors:**

  * **Warrior/Jungle:** Focuses on heroic virtues like strength, combat, and "toughness," which the author dismisses as pathological and misleading for most corporate life.

  * **Polis (City-State):** The more representative metaphor, focusing on a prosperous, sophisticated community. Virtues here are **genteel and congenial** (e.g., charm, wit, generosity) and applicable across all levels.

  * **Aristotle's Focus:** In a genteel society, **justice** (fairness, deliberation) and **honor** (reputation, the sum of virtues) are paramount, not military prowess.

### 3. Historical Shifts in Virtues

* **The Rise of Individualism:** The domination of Christianity and the rise of the individual (e.g., Calvin, Adam Smith) shifted focus away from the social *polis* to the individual soul.

* **Moral Virtues Become Primary:** The congenial and warrior virtues were demoted, and what we now call the **moral virtues** became primary, often associated with abstinence (e.g., not lying, not cheating) and abstract rules of reason (like the Ten Commandments).

### 4. Re-evaluating "Toughness"

* **Toughness is Multifaceted:** "Toughness" is a complex and often misunderstood business virtue, frequently confused with incompetence, stubbornness, or meanness.

* **Toughness as Skill/Perseverance:** It is often a **skill** (e.g., in negotiating) or **perseverance** (sticking to a worthy goal despite setbacks), which is a genuine virtue (subject to Aristotle's standard of moderation).

* **Toughness and "Dirty Hands":** The most ethically painful element is the willingness to make difficult, sometimes *otherwise unjust*, decisions (like layoffs to save the company).

  * **Crucial Distinction:** True toughness involves **pain, guilt, and the willingness to act humanely**, while **callousness and indifference** are signs of weakness and a denial of moral issues.

* **Ultimate Goal:** Toughness is having a **vision and persevering** for the long term, and it must yield to other virtues like compassion or fairness. It is ultimately a form of **moral courage**, not mean-spiritedness.

### 5. Conclusion: People Before Profits

The **Aristotelian approach** to business ethics insists on moving away from both traditional individualistic ethics and rigid "bottom-line" thinking. It argues that:

* Humans are **social creatures** who derive identity and worth from their communities (including the corporation).

* There is no "business world" apart from the people in it; therefore, the **integrity of the people determines the integrity of the organization** (and vice versa).

* The ethical "bottom line" is that **people come before profits**.
