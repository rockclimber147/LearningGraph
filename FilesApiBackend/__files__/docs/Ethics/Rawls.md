# Rawls

## Social Contract content

* hypothetical state of nature without society

* benefits derived from living in society

Contracts must be consent based and reciprocally beneficial

People don't deserve to be born rich or poor, gifted or stunted. So they shouldn't be favored by societal institutions for this reason. Rawls argues for equality based reciprocity: All goods are to be distributed equally unless unequal distribution is to everyone's benefit.

Rawls's ideas attempt to

* establish basic rights

* address social/economic inequalities

According to Rawls, meritocracy doesn't work because of the natural lottery

We should reward those based on merit but in a way that benefits those who lost out

1. Each person engaged in an institution or affected by it has an equal right to the most extensive liberty compatible with a like liberty for all

2. 1. difference principle: Inequalities are arbitrary unless it is reasonable to expect they will work to everyone’s advantage

   2. provided that the positions and offices to which they attach, or from which they may be gained are open to all (formal equality of opportunity)
