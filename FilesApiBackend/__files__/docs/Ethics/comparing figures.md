| **Figure**              | **Core Ethical/Philosophical Concept**                                                                                                     | **Relation to Kantian (Duty)**                                                                                                                                                                 | **Relation to Utilitarianism (Consequence)**                                                                                                                                                                       | **Relation to Virtue Ethics (Character)**                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Key Contrast**                                                                                                                                         |
| **Aristotle**           | **Eudaimonia (Flourishing)**, the "Golden Mean," character development through habit.                                                      | Least related. Focus is on **character**, not universal duties/rules.                                                                                                                          | Least related. Focus is on **internal state/character**, not calculating the greatest good for the greatest number.                                                                                                | **Directly related/Founder.** Ultimate ethical goal is achieving *Eudaimonia* through developing **virtues** like courage and temperance.                                                                                         | Contrasts sharply with modern focus on rights (Locke) or consequences (Friedman).                                                                        |
| **Hume**                | **Moral Sentiment (Feeling)**, sympathy, and passion as the source of morality (not reason). Is/Ought Problem.                             | Indirectly challenges: Argued that pure reason (Kant's basis) **cannot** be the source of moral distinctions.                                                                                  | More aligned than Kantianism. Morality is a practical matter rooted in **social utility** (sympathy promotes social stability).                                                                                    | Related through **social virtues**. Sympathy (a social feeling) is key to moral judgments and social interaction.                                                                                                                 | Contrasts with rationalists (Kant, Rawls) by making **feeling** primary and reason secondary in moral judgment.                                          |
| **Locke**               | **Natural Rights** (Life, Liberty, Property), Social Contract Theory, Limited Government.                                                  | Strongly Aligned: His concept of **natural rights** imposes **absolute duties/constraints** on others (e.g., duty not to violate property).                                                    | Unaligned: His focus on **individual rights** would protect the minority, even if violating those rights maximized overall utility.                                                                                | Unaligned: Focus is on **rights and political structure**, not the cultivation of personal character.                                                                                                                             | Contrasts with Hobbes's absolute state, emphasizing individual constraints and rights.                                                                   |
| **Adam Smith**          | **Sympathy** (Moral Sentiments), The **Invisible Hand** (Wealth of Nations).                                                               | Unaligned: Focuses on **social interaction and economic consequences**, not universal duties.                                                                                                  | Indirectly Aligned: The **Invisible Hand** suggests that self-interest in the market *unintentionally* maximizes the **economic benefit** of society (a utility-maximizing outcome).                               | Related: The *Theory of Moral Sentiments* bases morality on the **impartial spectator**—a judgment formed through sympathy and social virtues.                                                                                    | Contrasts with the later highly individualistic, pure market models (like Friedman's), retaining a foundational belief in social morality and sympathy.  |
| **Rawls**               | **Justice as Fairness**, Original Position, Veil of Ignorance, **Two Principles of Justice** (Liberty Principle and Difference Principle). | Strongly Aligned: The principles derived from the Original Position are **non-negotiable duties** (rules/rights), especially the Liberty Principle. Highly **deontological** in its structure. | Unaligned: His framework is designed to explicitly **limit** utilitarianism, ensuring the well-being of the least advantaged is protected and **not** sacrificed for the greater good.                             | Unaligned: Focus is on **just institutions/rules**, not personal character development.                                                                                                                                           | Contrasts with Nozick (Minimal State) by demanding substantive duties (Difference Principle) from the state to correct inequalities.                     |
| **Nozick**              | **Entitlement Theory** (Justice in Acquisition, Transfer, Rectification), **Minimal State** (Night-Watchman State).                        | Highly Aligned: His theory of rights (e.g., the right to property) functions as **strict, inviolable, non-negotiable duties** that constrain all actions and the state.                        | Unaligned: Strongly anti-utilitarian. Any redistributive action aimed at maximizing welfare violates fundamental rights and is illegitimate.                                                                       | Unaligned: Focus is strictly on **rights and justice in holdings**, not internal character traits.                                                                                                                                | Contrasts with Rawls (Substantive State) by arguing that any government beyond basic protection of rights violates individual autonomy.                  |
| **Milton Friedman**     | **Shareholder Primacy**, maximize profit within the rules of the game (free competition, without fraud).                                   | Unaligned (in business): Places the **duty** to shareholders above other rules or duties.                                                                                                      | Strongly Aligned (economic): The **assumption** is that maximizing corporate profit within the law is the most **efficient** way to allocate resources, thereby maximizing overall **utility/wealth** for society. | Unaligned: Focus is on economic and legal rules, not personal virtues.                                                                                                                                                            | Contrasts with the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the stakeholder theory (Solomon), which broaden the scope of corporate duty.        |
| **Solomon (Robert C.)** | **Aristotelian Business Ethics**, "Ethics and Excellence," focus on community, integrity, and shared purpose in the corporation.           | Unaligned: Focuses on the **social context/community** and character, not abstract rules.                                                                                                      | Unaligned: Rejects the singular focus on the **"bottom line"** (the utilitarian outcome of profit).                                                                                                                | **Directly related/Proponent.** Applies the Aristotelian framework to the corporation, emphasizing virtues like **trust, fairness, and toughness** (as moral courage) to achieve corporate *Eudaimonia* (excellence/flourishing). | Contrasts sharply with Friedman by arguing that business is fundamentally a **social and moral activity** and that people (virtues) come before profits. |
