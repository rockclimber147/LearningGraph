| **U** | **K** | **V** | **Action**                                                                                                                                                                               | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **1** | **1** | **1** | **Giving an honest, well-reasoned performance review to an employee.**                                                                                                                   | **U (1):** Maximizes long-term aggregate well-being (improving performance, motivating the employee). **K (1):** Treats the employee as an end, not merely a means; the maxim of honesty can be universalized. **V (1):** Demonstrates the virtues of fairness, honesty, and justice.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **1** | **1** | **0** | **Telling a harmless, slightly inflated story about one's minor achievements at a party to make a large group of people laugh.**                                                         | **U (1):** Maximizes aggregate pleasure/happiness for the group. **K (1):** The lie is trivial, and the maxim might be universalizable without contradiction (unlike a lying promise). **V (0):** The action displays the vice of vanity or slight dishonesty, rather than the virtue of truthfulness or modesty.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **1** | **0** | **1** | **A courageous whistle-blower reveals a company's safety fraud, leading to their personal ruin.**                                                                                        | **U (1):** The public good (safety) far outweighs the personal suffering of the whistle-blower, maximizing aggregate utility. **K (0):** The act, while noble, might be difficult to universalize as a strict *duty* if it required self-destruction. Kantianism primarily focuses on **duty** as the motivating factor, and this action is often supra-obligatory. **V (1):** Demonstrates the cardinal virtues of **courage, integrity, and justice.**                                    |
| **1** | **0** | **0** | **Telling a significant lie to the police that prevents them from catching a thief who has stolen a tiny, replaceable item, thus saving the thief from a harsh, life-ruining sentence.** | **U (1):** The immense negative utility of the thief's ruin is avoided, and the negative utility of the minor lie is negligible, maximizing aggregate happiness. **K (0):** Lying is an absolute duty violation; the maxim of "lying when convenient" cannot be universalized without destroying the institution of promising/communication. **V (0):** Displays the vice of habitual dishonesty and disregard for the law, failing the virtues of honesty and respect for justice.         |
| **0** | **1** | **1** | **A wealthy person donates only a small, token amount to charity, keeping the vast majority of their wealth.**                                                                           | **U (0):** Failure to act. A utilitarian would argue the wealth *ought* to be used to maximize global happiness/alleviate suffering, making the retention of the vast majority of the wealth impermissible. **K (1):** The act of giving a small amount satisfies the imperfect duty to benevolence. **V (1):** Displays the minimal virtue of generosity, or at least avoids the vice of miserliness.                                                                                      |
| **0** | **1** | **0** | **A miserly but dutiful baker always sells fresh goods for a fair price, motivated only by the absolute duty to honor contracts and not cheat customers.**                               | **U (0):** Failure to achieve the greatest possible good (e.g., they could give bread to the poor or use profits to increase well-being further). **K (1):** The action is done *from duty* (out of respect for the moral law/contract), giving it moral worth. **V (0):** The baker fails to display the virtue of generosity or friendliness, demonstrating the vice of miserliness or coldness, even if their actions are outwardly correct.                                             |
| **0** | **0** | **1** | **A person who has a reputation for being generous overspends on a lavish gift for their best friend, causing them financial stress for the month.**                                     | **U (0):** The net consequence is negative (friend's joy is outweighed by the stress and possible suffering of the giver and dependents). **K (0):** The action is based on self-love/emotion (e.g., the desire to feel generous), not duty, and is financially reckless. **V (1):** The action, while misguided, springs from the **virtuous disposition** of generosity and friendship. The person *is* generous, even if this specific act is imprudent (a failure of practical wisdom). |
| **0** | **0** | **0** | **Killing an innocent person because you hate them, when there are alternatives that would create more aggregate happiness for society.**                                                | **U (0):** Directly causes massive suffering, violating the Greatest Happiness Principle. **K (0):** Violates the Categorical Imperative—it cannot be universalized, and it treats a person merely as a means to satisfy hatred. **V (0):** Displays the vices of cruelty, malice, injustice, and a complete lack of temperance.                                                                                                                                                            |
